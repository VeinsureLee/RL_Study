# Reinforcement Learning with Python

This repository aims to record the study process, 
practice my coding skills,
and share knowledge about Reinforcement Learning (RL) using Python.

The textbooks I am following are:

1. "Mathematics Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning"by Shiyu Zhao, Westlake University Press, 2023.
2. "Hands on Reinforcement Learning" by Weinan Zhang, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press, 2021.

## 1. Grid world Example
The grid world agent is based on the code of book1. 
This repository add some algorithms 
including Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Q-learning and DQN, 
which are including in the book and not in the prim code.

## 2. Hands on RL Examples
The examples in this part are based on the code of book2.

This repository add some other algorithms such as Sarsa Expectation,...
